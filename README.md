The **Disease Prediction System** is a web-based application built using **Streamlit** and **Python**. It allows users to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on input features. The system uses pre-trained machine learning models to provide predictions for diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Lung Cancer, and Hypo-Thyroid.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of diseases using machine learning models.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for entering input features.
- **Multiple Diseases Supported**:
  - Diabetes Prediction
  - Heart Disease Prediction
  - Parkinson's Disease Prediction
  - Lung Cancer Prediction
  - Hypo-Thyroid Prediction
- **Real-Time Results**: Get instant predictions after entering the required inputs.
